# ClickrServer
A dynamic web project which can be hosted using apache tomcat.
Instructor will run the server and interact with it's web interface to create questions. 
There is no requirement of an internet connection. 
Students should have the Clickr mobile app, it is used to interact with the instructor's hosted server and attempt
the quiz.

Dependencies for the project: [gson v2.3.1](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/downloads/list?can=1&q=) and [polymer v0.5](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/)

#####I have drafted a new release, check releases page of this project.
It's a simple war file which can be deployed on apache tomcat server. There are numerous resources online which will tell you how to deploy a war file.

I made a detailed how-to pdf for deployment and developmental purposes, read [this](https://github.com/bhargavchippada/ClickrServer/blob/master/ClickrServerSetupInstructions.pdf)

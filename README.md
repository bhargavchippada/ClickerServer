# ClickrServer
A dynamic web project which can be hosted using apache tomcat.
Instructor will run the server and interact with it's web interface to create questions. 
There is no requirement of an internet connection. 
Students should have the Clickr mobile app, it is used to interact with the instructor's hosted server and attempt
the quiz.
#####I will write clear steps to run the server in near future, presently i am refining the code and documenting it.

If you want to figure it out on your own then i would suggest learning how to create and deploy simple dynamic web 
project. Deploying this project is similar.
